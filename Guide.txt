In this application I have connected application through windows authentication 
I created 3 tables 1 table for admin which have admin login details 
when you open app first enter Server name database name and also enter admin details through the first table
SeverName and DatabaseName will get saved in registry so that you dont have to enter that again and you will move on to next page.
on next page you can enter the detail of your user and can enter the Branch code to find out form which branch user belongs to.
